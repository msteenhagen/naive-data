# Naive Realism and Sense datum Theory

What is the disagreement between the Naive Realist and the Sense Datum Theorist? Instead of assuming this disagreement is about the nature of the objects of perception, as is commonly proposed, I suggest that we should locate this disagreement purely at the level of a proper characterisation of what pereiving is like. A basic methodology in the philosophy of perception tries to distil facts about the nature of perceptual experience from facts about what it is like to perceive. If perceptual experience is what it seems to us to be, then we may take such facts about what it is like to perceive at face value. My suggestion is that the Naive Realist and Sense Datum Theorist disagree about what facts we may take at face value, when we may take what it is like to perceive at face value.

## Phenomenology: taking phenomena at face value

The starting point for a theory of perception is the phenomenon of perception itself. ‘What is it like to perceive?’ Unless we have reason to think otherwise, we may take how perceptual experience seems to us ‘at face value’. 

So what is it like to perceive? As many have brought out, "Perceptual experience, in its character, involves the presentation (as) of ordinary mind-independent objects to a subject " (Crane and French). So if Crane and French are right, then perceptual experience seems to be a presentation of ordinary mind-independent objects. This suggests in turn that, if we may take this at face value, then perceptual experience is a presentation of ordinary mind-independent objects. The result is a Naive Realism about perceptual experience .

## The three rival theories

As is well known, many philosophers have brought out taht we cannot take the phenomenology of experience at face value. This has led some to conclude that we are presented with mind-dependent entities. Others resist this conclusion, but instead maintain that perception is a _representation_ of mind-independent entities. 

| Act / Object   | Mind-Independent    | Mind-Dependent |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Presentation   | Naive Realism       | Sense-Datum    |
| Representation | Representationalism | ?              |

It is this dialectic that has led to the currently dominant picture of the options. Here I focus mainly on the dispute between the Naive Realist and the Sense Datum Theorist. 

> [B]oth views hold that at least some perceptual experiences fundamentally consist in the subject bearing the perceptual relation to something. They just give a different account of what that something is. According to the sense-datum theory it’s a mind-dependent, immaterial sense-datum; while according to the Naive Realist, it’s a mind-independent material object in the subject’s environment.

## Moore on sense data

This however makes very little sense with the way sense-data come to be introduced. Both the Naive Realist and the Moore think that there is positive introspective support for the view that perception is a conscious presentation of objects that are distinct from and independent of the perception itself. In other words, the perception's _presentational_ nature is introspectively obvious. However, this does not obviously amount to any insight about the nature of the _object_ of perception. Moore goes on to preserve a neutral stance about the objects of perception even when he takes a stance on the idea that perception manifestly is presentational: 

> [T]here is no doubt at all that there are sense-data, in the sense in which I am now using that term. I am at present seeing a great number of them, and feeling others. And in order to point out to the reader what sort of things I mean by sense-data, I need only ask him to look at his own right hand. If he does this he will be able to pick out something (and, unless he is seeing double, only one thing) with regard to which he will see that it is, at first sight, a natural view to take that that thing is identical, not, indeed, with his whole right hand, but with that part of its surface which he is actually seeing, but will also (on a little reflection) be able to see that it is doubtful whether it can be identical with the part of the surface of his hand in question. Things of the sort (in a certain respect) of which this thing is, which he sees in looking at his hand, and with regard to which he can understand how some philosophers should have supposed it to be the part of the surface of his hand which he is seeing, while others have supposed that it can’t be, are what I mean by ‘sense-data’. I therefore define the term in such a way that it is an open question whether the sense-datum which I now see in looking at my hand and which is a sense-datum of my hand is or is not identical with that part of its surface which I am now actually seeing.

To think that Naive Realism and Sense Datum Theory disagree in this way about the nature of the objects of perception is puzzling. On the one hand, the concept of sense data was introduced as a neutral term for the direct objects of perception. So to conceive of sense-data as essentially mind-dependent misconstrues some of the motivations and theories of the early sense-data theorists. 

On the other hand, when we understand the concept of the sense datum as a neutral term, then the sense data may turn out to be mind-independent objects in our environment. But that is what the naive realist claims to be the case. Therefore, we now seem to lose sight of the disagreement between Naive Realism and Sense Datum Theory. So we seem faced with a dilemma. Either we risk historical inaccuracy or we risk losing sight of the debate between Naive Realism and Sense Datum Theory.

Can we take ‘sense datum’ to be a neutral term while preserving the disagreement between naive realism and sense datum theory?

## Object and consciousness

A crucial point in Moore's philosophy is the sharp distinction between act and object. 

> We have then in every sensation two distinct elements, one which I call consciousness, and another which I call the object of consciousness.

When we introspect our experience, we are conscious of both. As Moore points out polemically, however, many philosophers have mistaken the one for the other. That is, they have mistaken facts about the object of consciousness for facts about consciousness itself.

Moore has an explanation for the oversight. 

> that which makes the sensation of blue a mental fact seems to escape us; it seems, if I may use a metaphor, to be transparent — we look through it and see nothing but the blue

This explanation has taken a central role in current discussions about perception. However, it is easily overlooked what Moore's real point is. Typically, the point is used to suggest that there is nothing mental in the experience's phenomenology. But that is not what Moore says. His point is that it is hard to get the true phenomenology of the experience as such into view. 

Moore's point is that facts about how the experience seems to us when we introspect and facts about how the object of experience seems to us in such an act of reflection are distinct facts. 

Let’s consider an example. Say you are looking at a blue rug on the floor. In normal circumstances at least, such a perception has a phenomenology that suggests to you that you are conscious of something other than our own mind or perceptual experience. There’s seems to be something ‘out there’, so to say. Yet, the thing we’re conscious of cannot appear to us _simpliciter_; it will always appears to us in some way or other. If it is a blue rug, it is likely to appear blue. And at least if you are familiar with rugs, it will appear to be a rug.

Now of course, as people like P.F. Strawson have pointed out, when we ask someone to report on how their experience of seeing that rug strikes them, they are extremely likely to report that it seems to them as if they are presented with a blue rug. (Perhaps the ‘as if’ locution is unnatural to use here. The point is that they will report seeming to be visually aware of a rug.) However, if we are more careful here, then we should say that what they should have said was: “It seems to me as if I am presented with some other thing, something that appears to be a blue rug.” This description teases apart more carefully the two layers of appearance involved in the experience. It brings out that, strictly speaking, the experience-independence of the object seems to be manifest to us in a way that is different from the way the nature of the object of experience seems to be manifest to us. 

So when we introspect our perceptual experience, it may be hard to separate the way the experience strikes us from the way the object of experience strikes us. It may be easy to confuse the perception of the rug with the rug itself. A motivation for thinking this is that the former facts are obviously revealing about the experience's nature whereas the latter facts are at least doubtful with regards to the nature of which they are facts about. H.H. Price has a similar argument: 

> When I see a tomato there is much that I can doubt. I can doubt whether there is a tomato that I am seeing, and not a cleverly painted piece of wax. I can doubt whether there is any material thing there at all. Perhaps what I took for a tomato was really a reflection; perhaps I am even the victim of some hallucination. One thing however I cannot doubt: that there exists a red patch of a round and somewhat bulgy shape, standing out from a background of other colour-patches, and having a certain visual depth, and that this whole field of colour is directly present to my consciousness.

It is not obvious exactly what the second layer---the observation that the object of experience appears to be a rug----contributes to the theory of perception. (It would perhaps be more plausible to suggest that the second observation tells us something about the way rugs look, but again: rugs are not identical to perceptions of rugs.) The fact that some philosophers have conflated distinct facts is one of the main grievances Moore has about how his predecessors and contemporaries approach perception. Here is is mainly thinking of forms of Idealism, but he accuses the 'materialist' of making in essence the same mistake. Where the Idealist identifies the object with the act and goes on to focus on the act, the materialist identifies the object with the act and goes on to focus on the object.  

## Sense datum theory vs naive realism

I call the approach here Moorean Care. If we approach our experience with Moorean care, what does introspection yield? 

On the one hand Moore and Price take it to be obvious that “there is no doubt at all” that we are presented with sense-data.

On the other hand both agree that (to some extent at least) what these sense-data are is doubtful.

So what we cannot doubt is the nature of our consciousness (the presentation of an object), while what we can doubt is the nature of the object (and so should call it ‘the sense datum’, whatever it is)

Recall, the Naive Realist claims that perceptual experience seems to be a presentation of ordinary mind-independent objects. We now have resources to be more careful. If Moore is right, then we should distinguish between: 

- How the experience (consciousness) seems to us
- How the object of experience seems to us

But recall, the starting point for a theory of perception is the phenomenon of perception itself. So we should be investigating how the perceptual experience seems to us, and we shouldn’t confuse this with how the object of experience seems to us. 

- Perceptual experience seems to be a presentation of mind-independent objects in our environment
- Perceptual experience seems to be a presentation of seemingly mind-independent objects in our environment

We can compare the way both claims can be taken 'at face value' to bring out the relevant difference here: 

- Perceptual experience is a presentation of mind-independent objects in our environment
- Perceptual experience is a presentation of seemingly mind-independent objects in our environment

We see that the Naive Realist treats the introspective fact that experience seems presentational and the introspective fact that the objects of experience seem mind-independent as the same fact. Yet given Moore’s assumption that we should distinguish between consciousness and object, these are not the same fact: the one is indubitable, the other leaves room for doubt. 

If we accept this diagnosis, then we can use it to shed light on the disagreement between the Naive Realist and the Sense Datum Theorist. When you introspect your perceptual experience, you are likely to find that it seem to you as if you are aware of some entity that is distinct from the experience you are trying to introspect, and that, typically, that entity seems, at least on the basis of how it appears, to you to be (or be part of) some familiar physical object (e.g. a rug, or (the side of) a car). The Naive Realist suggests that in the philosophy of perception we may take all of this at face value, unless of course we hear an argument to the contrary (e.g. an argument from illusion or hallucination). In the absence of such arguments, these appearances may be taken to be a good guide to what perceptual experience is. Accordingly, for the Naive Realist the dialectical high- ground in the philosophy of perception—a high-ground they desire to occupy and defend—is the assumption that perceptual experience is a presentation of (a) an object distinct from the experience itself that (b) is just one of the familiar, physical objects in our environment (or perhaps some part of those).

On the other hand, the Sense Datum Theorist (and I am mainly thinking of Moore at the moment) suggests that the dialectical high-ground includes less than this. When we consider the starting point of the debate about perception or experience, we must not jump to conclusions about the nature of the objects we experience. So on the one hand, Moore accepts Transparency, and so accepts that if we take the experience at face value we may assume that perceptual experience is a presentation of some entity that is distinct from and independent of the experience we are introspecting. But he also urges us not to move beyond the appearance of that entity. If all we do is take the experience at face value, we should be careful not to overstep ourselves. All the experience gives us is an apparent presentation of an experience-independent thing that appears to be a familiar object. And because what we’re doing is report on how the character of the experience strikes us, not how the character of the object of experience strikes us, we shouldn’t say that the experience, when taken at face value, affords us access to the nature of that object (e.g. being a rug)—it would only afford us access to the appearance of that nature. In this way, Moore has grounds for correcting on the Naive Realist’s description of the phenomenology of perception, as he often seems to do.

If the project of finding the proper starting point in the philosophy of perception is indeed to be understood as a project of cashing out the ‘face value’ of perceptual experience, then the Naive Realist and the Sense Datum theorist seem to be in disagreement well before the Sense Datum theorist gets a chance to say what they take the objects of experience to be.

## Conclusions

The standard way of conceiving the disagreement between Naive Realism and Sense Datum Theory is as a disagreement about the nature of the objects of perception. But now we see that it is more accurate to conceive of it as a disagreement about whether facts about the nature of the objects of perception are facts about the perception itself. 

Approached in this way, we see that the disagreement between the Naive Realist and the Sense Datum Theorist need not be construed as about the nature of the objects of perception. My suggestion is that there is a more fundamental disagreement about the phenomenon of perception itself.
